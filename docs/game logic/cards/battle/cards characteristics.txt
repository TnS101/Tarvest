No such thing as a Graveyard : When a card is Discarded, It cannot be used for the remainder of the Battle.
When you have no cards in your Deck your Life is increasingly getting decremented (1,2,3,5,7,9, e.t.c) and you get a Random Card(Minor Arcana) in your Hand.
An Upside Card is counted as an 'Attack' Card, a Downside Card is counted as an 'Defence' Card.
